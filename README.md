## Monte Carlo Estimation of Sensitivities in Finance
Final project of the EPFL Stochastic Simulation course given by Prof. [Fabio Nobile](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=bFAkwyUAAAAJ&hl=en).

This project applied Monte Carlo methods to compute financial sensitivities on different asset classes.

Methods used in the project: 
 <ol>
  <li>Finite Difference method</li>
  <li>Pathwise derivative method</li>
  <li>Likelihood ratio method</li>
</ol> 

Financial contracts used in the project: 
 <ol>
  <li>European Call Option</li>
  <li>Digital Option</li>
  <li>Asian Option (path-dependant)</li>
</ol>

One can find the notebook with all the code related to the project and a PDF report describing methods and experiments. One can also find the presentation (pdf slides) used for the project's oral presentation.

The project was done in collaboration with [@evandieren](https://github.com/evandieren) during the 2022-2023 academic year at EPFL (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne).
