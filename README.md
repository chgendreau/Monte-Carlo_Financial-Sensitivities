## Monte Carlo estimation of Sensitivities in Finance
Final project of the EPFL course Stochastic Simulation course given by Prof. [Fabio Nobile](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=bFAkwyUAAAAJ&hl=en).

Application of Monte-Carlo methods to compute some financial sensitivities on different asset classes.

Methods used in the project: 
 <ol>
  <li>Finite Difference method</li>
  <li>Pathwise derivative method</li>
  <li>Likelihood ratio method</li>
</ol> 

Financial contracts used in the project: 
 <ol>
  <li>European Call Option</li>
  <li>Digital Option</li>
  <li>Asian Option (path-dependant)</li>
</ol>

One can find the notebook with all the code related to the project, as well as a PDF report describing methods and experiments. One can also find the presentation (pdf slides) which was used for the oral presentation of the project during the 2022 Winter exam session at EPFL (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne).

Project done in collaboration with [@evandieren](https://github.com/evandieren).
